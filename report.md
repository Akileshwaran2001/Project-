# N-BEATS Forecasting Project Report

## Overview
This project implements the N-BEATS neural architecture for multistep forecasting.

## Dataset
Any multivariate dataset can be used (ETT, M4, etc.).

## Model
A simplified N-BEATS block with fully connected layers.

## Training
Experiment with hyperparameters, stack depth, hidden size.

## Evaluation
Use MASE or sMAPE to compare with baseline models.
