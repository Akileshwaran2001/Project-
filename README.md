# N-BEATS Time Series Forecasting — Full Expanded Project

This project aims to design, implement, and optimize the N-BEATS neural network architecture for advanced multi-step time-series forecasting.
Using a complex real-world dataset, such as the ETT electricity transformer temperature data or a subset of the M4 competition dataset. 
The study investigates the effectiveness of deep-learning-based forecasting without explicit feature engineering. 
The N-BEATS model is constructed from scratch in TensorFlow or PyTorch, incorporating stack-level decomposition and residual block connections. 
Multiple hyperparameter configurations are evaluated to analyze their influence on predictive accuracy, model convergence, and computational efficiency. 
Performance results are compared against traditional baseline forecasting methods using metrics such as MASE and sMAPE. 
The findings highlight the model’s generalization capability and demonstrate.
The potential of N-BEATS to outperform classical statistical forecasting techniques.
